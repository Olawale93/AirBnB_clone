Functionality:
The interpreter supports commands like creating instances, showing instance details, deleting instances, listing all instances, counting instances, and updating instance attributes.
It handles commands in the format class.method(args) and processes them accordingly.
It includes error handling for missing class names, non-existent classes, missing instance IDs, and more.
Execution:
If the script is run directly, an instance of HBNBCommand is created, and the command loop is started.
Usage
Users can interact with the application by running this script and entering commands like create, show, destroy, all, count, and update followed by appropriate arguments.
This code provides a structured way to manage and manipulate instances within the application using a command-line interface.
